# Guardian MCP Server

An MCP server that connects an LLM to the archives (since 1999) of [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/), including the full text of all articles â€” more than 1.9 million of them. Useful for real-time headlines, journalism analysis, and historical research.

## Installation

**A [Guardian Open Platform](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/) API key is required.** You can get one here: https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/

The Guardian offers generous API access for *non-commercial* use of the archives, including up to 1 call/second and 500 calls/day. (See the full [Terms & Conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/open-platform/terms-and-conditions). Commercial use requires a [different license](https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/commercial).) 

**To install:**
```bash
npx guardian-mcp-server
```

**Sample MCP client configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "guardian": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["guardian-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "GUARDIAN_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tool reference

`guardian_search`: search the archive for articles

Use the`detail_level` parameter to determine the size of the API response and optimize performance: `minimal` (headlines only), `standard` (headlines, summaries, and metadata), or `full` (all content, including full article text).

```json
{
  "query": "climate change",
  "section": "environment", 
  "detail_level": "minimal",
  "from_date": "2024-01-01",
  "order_by": "newest"
}
```

`guardian_get_article`: retrieve individual articles
```json
{
  "article_id": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/01/example", 
  "truncate": false  // full content by default
}
```
`guardian_search_tags`: search through The Guardian's 50,000-plus hand-assigned tags

`guardian_find_related`: find articles similar to an article (via shared tags)

`guardian_get_article_tags`: returns tags assigned to any article

  "interval": "month"
}
```

`guardian_top_stories_by_date`: estimates editorial importance; The Guardian's API doesn't natively return data to differentiate between Page 1 stories and inside briefs, and this tries to hack a ranking together

  "story_count": 5
}
```
